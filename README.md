## 📚 About

This project was developed as part of a university assignment for the **Linear Algebra** course at UFMT.  
It demonstrates core numerical methods used to solve systems of linear equations and emphasizes user interaction via the command line.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python src/solver.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts:
    - Enter the number of variables in the system
    - Input the augmented matrix line by line

3. The program will:
    - Print the original matrix
    - Display the escalated (triangular) form
    - Return the solution for each variable
